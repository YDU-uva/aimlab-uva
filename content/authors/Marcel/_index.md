I did my masters at the Free University Amsterdam in Computer Science with a specialization in medical computer science. During my PhD work I focussed on image analysis both from a theoretical point of view, establishing the limits in accuracy one can achieve when measuring shape on a digital grid, to more applied shape analysis in biological and medical images. Part of this research was on deformable shape models and performed at Yale University. From there I moved to document and video analysis, spending four months in San Diego studying film theory and how it can help automatic video analysis, and subsequently more and more into the development of methods for accessing large image and video collections by their content. In such a setting, next to image analysis and understanding, user interaction is a crucial element and with it comes the need for advanced visualizations of the collection and the results of user queries. Currently we are taking this a step further into multimedia analytics being the integration of multimedia analysis, multimedia mining, information visualization, and multimedia interaction into a coherent framework yielding more than its constituent components.

Much of the research has been done in a multi-disciplinary setting, with applications in biology, medicine, broadcasting, forensics, urban analytics, and cultural heritage.
