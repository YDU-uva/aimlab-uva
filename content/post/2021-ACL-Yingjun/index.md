The research lab is focused on medical image analysis by machine learning, covering active scientific topics of broad interest, including both methods and applications. These topics range from low-level vision and data pre-processing tasks to high-level image/video analysis tasks. From a technical perspective, researchers at the AIM Lab will be working on fundamental and relatively general deep-learning models and algorithms, which will be applied to specific diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and cardiovascular diseases.
In particular, the AIM Lab will be focusing on the following seven projects in its first five years:

• Learning with limited data and its applications to medical image analysis

• Multi-task learning for medical image analysis and data mining

• Continual learning with its applications to medical image classification

• Out-of-distribution generalization for medical image analysis

• Jointly learning from medical images and health records

• Automated report generation from radiology images.
