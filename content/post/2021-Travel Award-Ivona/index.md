The MICCAI Student Travel Awards scheme serves two main functions:

1. To reward the best (such as highest scoring) first author students and to subsidise their attendance to the present their work at the annual MICCAI conference.

2. To assist in building the MICCAI community by selecting early career participants from countries of lower-income countries from where fewer papers are received and the authors are typically not well funded to attend international meetings.
